				<span class="story-title">Story of Patience</span><br><br>
				He is Nitin Rathore and was a cook in a restaurant. But he lost his job during this pandemic situation as all the restaurants were closed at that time. The owner of the restaurant also closed it due to financial difficulties after the lockdown. Because of which he and his family had to pass through even lack of everyday necessities, but his patience and faith in god kept him alive with a hope that one day he will get a new job.<br><br>
				Fortunately, he was brought in the eyes of SAHHAY and soon he was approached by one of our volunteer by whom his situation, talent, and previous job experiences were inquired. Within a day he was allotted a new job and even a week's amenities were supplied to his family too by us.<br><br>
				Now he is a happy chef at a local Dhaba nearer to his home. This is one of the thousands lives that SAHAAY has rescued, and this number just keeps on increasing daily. All we feel after each operation is "Happy to help".

				<span class="story-title">Story of Courage</span><br><br>
				This is the story of courageous woman who never gave up and her journey from a common housewife and helpless person to a working and independent woman. This all started in April 2020 when the whole planet was horrified and was struggling in a fight against a deadly virus and families like her were dying for necessities, as the only working person in the house lost his job and the family had no source of income and a very fewer savings left. <br><br>
				“My self Reshma Jain and I was just a housewife before I got an opportunity to convert my passion and hobby into a source of income when I needed it the most, under SAHAAY. When days started to feel like minutes and months like hours. Money had only one way of transaction outgoing and no incoming. Every hope to live without starvation was lost and that is when an SAHAAY steps into our lives to save us from a dreadful future. I was provided by a new job as a tailor in a factory. Our life was back on track, in fact even better. All thanks to SAHAAY for understanding and solving the problem in a way no one else did.”

				<span class="story-title">Story of Happiness</span><br><br>
				This story is about a small abandoned village near Bhuj, Gujarat named Lakhpur. Elders of the Lakhpur are  working far from home in the nearest city altogether in a factory to fulfill their needs. During this pandemic situation, factory  was closed for a while, they lost their jobs. Somehow we found out about their condition in mid pandemic and under urgent circumstances we arranged jobs for them. Their children were also provided with their current year’s school fees to save their precious one year. We are overwhelmed at that time after seeing smile of happiness on their faces. Remembering about it makes us all at SAHAAY proud at the most.
